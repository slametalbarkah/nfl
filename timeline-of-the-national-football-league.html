<h1>Timeline of the National Football League</h1>
            
            This timeline of the National Football League (NFL) tracks the history of each of the league's 32 current franchises from the early days of the league, through its merger with the American Football League (AFL). The history of franchises that began as independent teams, or as members of the Ohio League, New York Pro Football League, and other defunct leagues are shown as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Timeline ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 1920–1932: Birth of the NFL ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1920 ===<br/><br/>The American Professional Football Association is formed on September 17, 1920, at Canton, Ohio, with Jim Thorpe elected president. The fourteen teams were mainly drawn from the Ohio League, Chicago Circuit, New York Pro Football League and other teams from the lower midwest. A $100 membership fee was charged. The Chicago Tigers folded after the season.<br/><br/>The Massillon Tigers were represented at the September 17 meeting by Ralph Hay, but they never played in the league. As such, they are considered a charter member on a technicality.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1921 ===<br/><br/>The American Professional Football Association is reorganized at Akron, Ohio on April 30, 1921, with Joe F. Carr elected as new league president. With the low entry barrier of a $100 membership fee, the number of teams balloons to 21.
