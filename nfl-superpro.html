<h1>NFL SuperPro</h1>
            
            NFL SuperPro is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics, centered on Phillip "Phil" Grayfield, an ex-National Football League (NFL) player who survives a freak accident and wears a near-indestructible football uniform. Produced in collaboration with the NFL and originally written by Fabian Nicieza and artist Jose Delbo, the series started publication in 1991 and ended after 12 issues.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Outline ==<br/><br/>Nicieza wrote a story centering on Phil Grayfield, once an aspiring football player. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a sports reporter and interviewed an eccentric football superfan, who also happened to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an individual basis and costs five million dollars to construct — so it is worth a fortune.<br/><br/>Suddenly interrupting the interview, thieves raid the superfan's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal a van load of NFL merchandise (but not the uniform), and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up and helpless, knocks over experimental chemicals, which — in combination with the fire and ultra-rare football souvenirs going up in flames — do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.<br/><br/>Grayfield puts on the superfan's football uniform and brings the villains to justice, dedicating his life to fighting crime and dubbing himself "SuperPro".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Publication history ==<br/><br/>The first issue starring NFL SuperPro was "NFL SuperPro Special Edition # 1", cover-dated March 1991.
