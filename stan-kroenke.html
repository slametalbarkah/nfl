            Enos Stanley Kroenke (; born July 29, 1947) is an American billionaire real estate magnate and sports team owner. He is the owner of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, which is the holding company of Arsenal F.C. of the Premier League and Arsenal W.F.C. of the Women's Super League, the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL, Denver Nuggets of the NBA, Colorado Avalanche of the NHL, Colorado Rapids of MLS, Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League, the Los Angeles Gladiators of the Overwatch League, and the Los Angeles Guerrillas of the Call of Duty League.<br/><br/>The Nuggets and Avalanche franchises are held in the name of his wife, Ann Walton Kroenke, to evade NFL rules that forbid a team owner from having teams in other markets. Ann, part of the Walton family, is the daughter of Walmart co-founder James "Bud" Walton. Kroenke was estimated to be worth US$10.7 billion by Forbes in 2022.<br/><br/>Kroenke's holding company for sports teams has been controversial. In 2016, he broke contracts by moving the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles, incurring legal costs for the entire league. In 2021, Kroenke was involved in a failed effort to end the traditional European soccer system by creating a closed European Super League that would have included Arsenal and several other teams.<br/><br/>In the five major U.S. sports, Kroenke's teams have won six championships under his ownership (either partial or full), with the Rams winning two Super Bowls, the Avalanche winning two Stanley Cups, the Nuggets winning one NBA Championship, and the Rapids winning one MLS Cup.
