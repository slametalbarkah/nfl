            The National Football League (NFL) has been playing games in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, since 1959 when an interleague game between the Chicago Cardinals of the NFL and the Toronto Argonauts (often shortened as Argos) of the Canadian Football League (CFL) took place at Exhibition Stadium. Subsequently, a number of neutral site preseason and regular season games between NFL teams have been staged in the city. Toronto is one of six cities outside the United States, along with London, Mexico City, Frankfurt, São Paulo, and Munich, which have hosted regular season NFL games.<br/><br/>There have long been efforts to establish an NFL franchise in Toronto due to its market size. Toronto is among the largest cities in the United States and Canada, and the largest that is not home to an NFL team. The city hosts franchises in all of the other US-based major professional North American sports in the United States and Canada. As of 2020, the league has expressed interest in establishing a team in the city provided certain conditions are met, the most crucial being the construction of a new football-specific stadium.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Games played in Toronto ==<br/><br/>The first professional U.S. football team to play a home game in Toronto was the Los Angeles Wildcats of the American Football League of 1926, the first major competitor to the National Football League for the dominance of professional football.  While the Wildcats nominally represented Los Angeles, travel to the west coast posed a major obstacle at the time so the team was instead a traveling team based in Illinois.  They played most of their games in the home stadiums of their opponents, with the exception of the Toronto game.
