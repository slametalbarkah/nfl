            Aaron Josef Hernandez (November 6, 1989 – April 19, 2017) was an American professional football player who was a tight end in the National Football League (NFL). He played three seasons with the New England Patriots until his arrest and conviction for the murder of Odin Lloyd.<br/><br/>Hernandez played college football for the Florida Gators, earning first-team All-American honors and winning the 2009 BCS National Championship Game. Due to concerns towards his size and off the field incidents, he was not selected until the fourth round of the 2010 NFL draft by the Patriots at 20 years old. Alongside teammate Rob Gronkowski, Hernandez formed one of the league's most dominant tight end duos, becoming the first pair to score at least five touchdowns each in consecutive seasons for the same team. He also made an appearance in Super Bowl XLVI.<br/><br/>During the 2013 offseason, Hernandez was arrested and charged for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Following his arrest, Hernandez was immediately released by the Patriots. He was found guilty of first-degree murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center. While on trial for Lloyd's murder, Hernandez was also indicted for the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. He was acquitted after a 2017 trial.
