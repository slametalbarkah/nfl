            The NFL championships describes both the Championship games of the National Football League, which ran from 1920 to 1969; and the Super Bowl, which has run from 1966 to the present. Many players and teams have won these championships on multiple occasions, both during the NFL championships and the Super Bowl era. The majority of these players were on the Green Bay Packers between 1960 and 1967, a period in which the Packers won three NFL championships and the first two Super Bowl games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Seven championships ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tom Brady (quarterback) won Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII with the New England Patriots after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons, respectively. He won Super Bowl LV with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2020 season. Otto Graham also has 7 NFL Championships all with the Cleveland Browns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Six championships ==<br/><br/>Three players have won six championships counting the pre-Super Bowl era. To avoid double counting from 1966 to 1969, only the NFL championships from 1920–1965 and the Super Bowls from 1966 onward are counted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fuzzy Thurston (offensive lineman) won the NFL championships with the Baltimore Colts in 1958, with the Green Bay Packers in 1961, 1962 and 1965, and won Super Bowls I and II with the Packers after the 1966 and 1967 seasons.<br/><br/>Forrest Gregg (offensive lineman) won the NFL championships with the Green Bay Packers in 1961, 1962 and 1965, Super Bowls I and II with the Packers after the 1966 and 1967 seasons, and Super Bowl VI with the Dallas Cowboys after the 1971 season.
