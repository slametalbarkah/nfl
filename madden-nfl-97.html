            Madden NFL 97 is a football video game released in 1996. It was the first Madden game released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. 16-bit versions were also made for the established Super NES and Genesis platforms, as well as a portable version for the Game Boy.<br/><br/>This is the first edition of Madden to implement a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also features the new Baltimore Ravens, formerly the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96), which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and can be played by using a cheat code.<br/><br/>Madden NFL 97 was the best-selling PlayStation game of 1996.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Development ==<br/><br/>The player graphics were created by using 3D models with motion capture data to produce 2D sprites from multiple angles.<br/><br/>Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.
