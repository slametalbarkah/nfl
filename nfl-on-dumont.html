<h1>NFL on DuMont</h1>
            
            The NFL on DuMont was an American television program that broadcast National Football League (NFL) games on the now defunct DuMont Television Network. The program ran from 1951 to 1955.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>DuMont's NFL coverage consisted of contracts the network signed with individual NFL teams. Only for the NFL Championship Game did the network actually sign a contract with the league. Some teams did not have deals with DuMont; instead selling television rights to local stations, independent producers, or breweries who were major sponsors and who also packaged the telecasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1951-1952 ===<br/><br/>Locally and regionally televised games were broadcast as early as 1939, but on December 23, 1951, DuMont televised the first ever live, coast-to-coast professional football game, the NFL Championship Game between the Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns. DuMont paid $75,000 for the rights to broadcast the game.<br/><br/>In 1952, DuMont only aired New York Giants games before moving to a more national scope the following season.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1953-1954 ===<br/><br/>During the 1953 and 1954 seasons, DuMont broadcast Saturday night NFL games. It was the first time that National Football League games were televised live, coast-to-coast, in prime time, for the entire season.
