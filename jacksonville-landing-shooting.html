            The Jacksonville Landing shooting, also known as the Jacksonville shooting, was a mass shooting that occurred at a video game tournament for the video game Madden NFL 19 in Jacksonville Landing, Jacksonville, Florida, United States, on August 26, 2018, at about 1:30 pm (EDT). A lone gunman, David Katz, shot and killed two people and injured ten others before killing himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Shooting ==<br/><br/>The GLHF (Good Luck Have Fun) Game Bar, a video game venue in the Jacksonville Landing indoor marketplace, hosted a Madden NFL 19 video gaming tournament on August 26, 2018, with around 130 to 150 participants and fans. After one of the participants, David Katz, lost a game, he refused to shake the hand of the winner and left the tournament. Soon after, he returned with one of the two handguns he had brought to the event.<br/><br/>Katz fired 12 shots, killing two people and wounding ten others, then committed suicide. One more sustained injuries while fleeing. A tournament announcer said that he had been interviewing the first victim before the interviewee was fatally shot, and that he had been intentionally targeted. The gunman then turned and began shooting indiscriminately.<br/><br/>Gunfire was first reported on social media at 1:34 pm EDT by tournament participants.
