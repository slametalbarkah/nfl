            A head coach, senior coach, or manager is a professional responsible for training and developing athletes within a sports team. This role often has a higher public profile and salary than other coaching positions. In some sports, such as association football and professional baseball, this role is referred to as the "manager," while in others, like Australian rules football, it is called "senior coach."<br/><br/>The head coach typically reports to a sporting director or general manager. In professional sports, where senior players are full-time employees under contract, the head coach often functions similarly to a general manager. Other coaches within the organization usually report to the head coach and specialize in areas such as offense or defense, with further subdivisions into specific roles like position coaches.<br/><br/>In youth sports, the head coach often serves as the primary representative of the coaching staff, managing communication with parents and overseeing the overall development of young athletes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== American football ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Head coaching responsibilities in American football vary depending on the level of the sport.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== High school football ===<br/><br/>As with most other head coaches, high school coaches are primarily tasked with organizing and training football players. This includes creating game plans, evaluating players, and leading the team during competition, deciding how the team is lined up, or their formation.<br/><br/>High school head coaches also have a variety of responsibilities beyond the football field.
