            The Washington Commanders are a professional American football team based in the Washington metropolitan area. The Commanders compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The franchise was founded by George Preston Marshall as the Boston Braves in 1932 and changed its name to the Redskins the following year before moving to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Redskins in 1937. The usage of the term "redskin" was controversial for decades before it was retired in 2020 as part of a wave of national name changes in the wake of the George Floyd protests, with the franchise playing as the Washington Football Team before rebranding as the Commanders in 2022.<br/><br/>The Commanders plays its home games at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, with its headquarters and training facility located in Ashburn, Virginia. The Commanders have played more than 1,300 games and have won more than 600. Washington was among the first NFL franchises with a fight song, "Hail to the Commanders", which is played by their marching band after every home game touchdown. The franchise won the 1937 and 1942 NFL championships and Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. The Commanders have finished a season as league runner-up six times, losing the 1936, 1940, 1943, and 1945 title games and Super Bowls VII and XVIII. Washington has 26 playoff appearances and 14 division titles, with their three Super Bowl wins tied with the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders.<br/><br/>All of Washington's championships were attained during two 10-year spans. From 1936 to 1945, the team went to the NFL Championship six times, winning two of them under general manager Jack Espey and head coach Ray Flaherty.
