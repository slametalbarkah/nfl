            This list of current National Football League (NFL) stadiums includes their locations, capacities, their first year of usage, and home teams. Although the NFL has 32 teams, there are only 30 full-time NFL stadiums. This is because the New York Giants and New York Jets share MetLife Stadium, and the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers share SoFi Stadium.<br/><br/>The newest full-time NFL stadiums are SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, and Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Raiders. Both stadiums opened for the 2020 season. Soldier Field in Chicago is the oldest, having opened in 1924; however, the Bears did not play at Soldier Field until 1971 and did not play there in 2002 while the stadium was under reconstruction, and thus the oldest continuously operating stadium in the NFL is Lambeau Field, hosting the Green Bay Packers since its opening in 1957.<br/><br/>The NFL uses several other stadiums on a regular basis in addition to the teams' designated regular home sites. In England, two London venues – Wembley Stadium and from 2016 to 2018 the Twickenham Stadium then the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – are contracted to host a combined four games per season, as part of the NFL International Series which runs through 2022. Estadio Azteca in Mexico City hosted NFL International Series games in 2016, 2017, and 2019, and was under contract to host one game per season through 2021. In addition, Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio, is the location of the annual exhibition Pro Football Hall of Fame Game.
