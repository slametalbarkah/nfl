            The NFL playoffs for the 2024 season began on January 11, 2025, and concluded with Super Bowl LIX on February 9 at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, when the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs 40–22 to win their second Super Bowl in franchise history.<br/><br/>All playoff teams in both conferences won at least 10 games, the first time since 2012 and the first time since the NFL playoffs expanded to a 14-team format in 2020. This was the second time since their respective moves to Los Angeles where the Rams and Chargers both qualified for the playoffs, after 2018.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Participants ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Within each conference, the four division winners and the top three non-division winners with the best overall regular season records qualified for the playoffs. The four division winners are seeded 1–4 based on their overall won-lost-tied record, and the wild card teams are seeded 5–7. The NFL does not use a fixed bracket playoff system, and there are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. In the first round, dubbed the Wild Card playoffs, the second-seeded division winner hosts the seventh seed wild card, the third seed hosts the sixth seed, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth seed. The 1 seed from each conference receives a first-round bye. In the second round, the Divisional playoffs, the number 1 seed hosts the lowest-seeded surviving team from the first round (seed 4, 5, 6, or 7), while the other two surviving teams play each other, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The two surviving teams from each conference's divisional playoff games then meet in the respective AFC and NFC Conference Championships, hosted by the higher seed.
