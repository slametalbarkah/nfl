            The 2007 NFL season was the 88th regular season of the National Football League (NFL).<br/><br/>Regular-season play was held from September 6 to December 30. The campaign kicked off with the defending Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFL Kickoff Game.<br/><br/>The New England Patriots became the first team to complete the regular season undefeated since the league expanded to a 16-game regular season in 1978. Four weeks after the playoffs began on January 5, 2008, the Patriots' bid for a perfect season was dashed when they lost to the New York Giants 17–14 in Super Bowl XLII, the league championship game at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on February 3.<br/><br/>For the first time, two divisions (the NFC East and the AFC South) had no team finish with a losing record.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Draft ==<br/><br/>The 2007 NFL draft was held from April 28 to 29, 2007, at New York City's Radio City Music Hall. With the first pick, the Oakland Raiders selected quarterback JaMarcus Russell from Louisiana State University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== New referee ==<br/><br/>John Parry was promoted to referee, replacing Bill Vinovich, who was forced to resign due to a heart condition. Vinovich would then serve as a replay official from 2007 to 2011.
