            The following nicknames are given to a unit (defensive, offensive and special teams) or a secondary nickname given to some teams used to describe a style of play or attitude of teams at times in accordance with phrases in popular culture of the time. They are not the official franchise nicknames of the National Football League (NFL). Since the NFL's inception in 1920, players, coaches, team executives, league officials, and football games have been given nicknames based on either individual achievements, team achievements, historical events, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Teams and units ==<br/><br/>Nicknames for entire teams, whole offensive units, defensive units, or special teams.<br/><br/>Names which are marked by an asterisk (*) are team nicknames which may have been coined by team members or local media, but never became well known to the public outside of the teams media market for a multitude of reasons, but most likely due to poor performance. The nickname was earned for accomplishments on the field.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== A ===<br/><br/>Ain'ts: Nickname given to the New Orleans Saints after their 1980 season of 14 consecutive losses. The name persisted somewhat as, although they would later qualify for the playoffs several times since then, they did not win a playoff game until their defeat of the defending Super Bowl champion Rams in the wild-card round of the 2000–01 playoffs.<br/><br/>America's Team: Nickname given to the Dallas Cowboys for having a large number of fans outside its immediate local area (The term itself is likely derived from the title of the team's 1978 highlight film.).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== B ===<br/><br/>The Bickering Bills: The 1989 Buffalo Bills, so-called due to internal conflict within the organization between quarterback Jim Kelly and several veteran players as well as a fistfight that occurred between two assistant coaches.
