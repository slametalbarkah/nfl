            The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers have competed in the National Football League (NFL) since 1921, two years after their original founding by Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun. They are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) and play their home games at Lambeau Field in central Wisconsin.<br/><br/>In 1969, the Pro Football Hall of Fame selected the NFL 50th Anniversary All-Time Team to celebrate the best players of the league's first 50 years. In addition to the 16 players named to the team, 2 runners-up were named for each of the 15 positions, for a total of 46 players. Jim Thorpe was given a special distinction "as the star that never diminishes". In 1994, the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team was selected with the same purpose: to honor the best players of the league's first 75 years. Instead of the Pro Football Hall of Fame choosing the team, "a 15-person panel of NFL and Pro Football Hall of Fame officials, former players and media members" made the selections. In addition to the main team, a special "two-way team" was selected to honor players who played significant time at both offensive and defensive positions. In total, 48 players were named to the 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, with Gale Sayers being named to 2 positions (halfback and kick returner).
