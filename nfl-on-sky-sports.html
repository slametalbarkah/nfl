            NFL on Sky Sports, previously known as NFL Special, is Sky Sports' flagship live American football programme, broadcasting live National Football League on Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays over the course of a season. It is normally broadcast on Sky Sports Main Event or Sky Sports NFL. As of 2020, the broadcaster will be showing every Thursday night, Sunday night and Monday night game live, alongside two Sunday evening games.<br/><br/>As of the 2019 season, the show is presented by Neil Reynolds, with Jeff Reinebold, Shaun Gayle and Rob Ryan as regular co-analysts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Broadcast times ==<br/><br/>As of the 2019 season, NFL on Sky Sports airs Thursday Night Football, two games on a Sunday evening (kicking off at 6:05pm &amp; 9:25pm), NBC Sunday Night Football (at 1:20am on Monday morning), and Monday Night Football on Tuesday at 1:15am. Highlights from NFL RedZone, which is broadcast on Sky Sports Mix, are shown and commented on by Reynolds and his analysts. An additional game on Sunday may also be shown in the afternoon if live from London.<br/><br/>Until 2015, the programme aired all of the NFL London Games games live from Wembley Stadium, and also offered exclusive live coverage of the playoffs and live coverage of the Super Bowl. Since 2015, they only air a minimum of two London Games, coverage being shared with the BBC. As of the 2019 season, Sky Sports have exclusive coverage of both London Games at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the playoffs, whilst live coverage of the Super Bowl is available on both Sky Sports and BBC Sport in the UK.<br/><br/>From the 2015 season, Sky Sports secured live coverage of NBC's Sunday Night Football coverage and ESPN's Monday Night Football, giving Sky live rights to every NFL game during the season for the first time ever. Similarly to Thursday Night Football, Sky Sports uses feeds from the American network to cover the late night Sunday game and the Monday game.<br/><br/>In August 2020, it was confirmed that Sky and the NFL has agreed a new five-year partnership which would see them continue to broadcast games until the end of the 2024 season.
