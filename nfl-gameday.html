            NFL GameDay (stylized as NFL GameDay Morning presented by Lowe's (Sunday regular season mornings only) or NFL GameDay Morning presented by Intuit TurboTax (playoff and Super Bowl editions only), NFL GameDay Live presented by GEICO (at the start of 1 PM and 4 PM (ET) doubleheader games),  NFL GameDay Highlights presented by CDW (after 1 PM and 4 PM (ET) doubleheader games) and NFL GameDay Prime presented by Mercedes-Benz (after Sunday night games) for sponsorship reasons) is an American television program that features highlights of the National Football League games for the day. It airs on the NFL Network, having debuted on September 10, 2006. The program starts at either 11:00 p.m. Eastern time or the moment that NBC Sunday Night Football concludes, whichever is later. When NBC does not carry a game, it begins at 8 p.m. ET, or after NFL RedZone goes off the air, which happened twice in 2006, on October 22 and December 24, and also on December 31, 2017.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Summary ==<br/><br/>Rich Eisen was the initial anchor, and former NFL defensive back Deion Sanders and head coach Steve Mariucci were the analysts when NFL GameDay debuted in September 2006.<br/><br/>NFL Network claims that this is the only long-form highlight show about the league in the late-night slot on Sunday, although Chris Berman and Tom Jackson host extended packages called "The Blitz" as part of SportsCenter.<br/><br/>On October 1, 2006, Week 4 of the season, Eisen missed the program.  No reason was given for his absence, but Fran Charles filled in as host of the show, just as he sometimes does on NFL Total Access.
