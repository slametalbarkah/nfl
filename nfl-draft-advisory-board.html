<h1>NFL Draft Advisory Board</h1>
            
            The NFL Draft Advisory Board (sometimes initialized as the NFLDAB) is a panel of professional football scouting experts who offer advisory opinions to college football players as to the likely level of demand for the players' services during the NFL draft.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>The board was created in 1994 to assist those college football players who were eligible to continue playing NCAA football or enter the NFL draft. Although the NFL had begun permitting such "underclassmen" to apply for the draft in 1989, within a few years it was clear that commission-based sports agents had deluded many of them as to their likely demand by teams and future salaries. 76 of the first 165 underclassmen to apply were not drafted, and once a college football player has entered the draft, he is no longer eligible to play college football. Thus, it was important that such players understand whether they would likely be among the small number of players drafted, and what their salaries might be, before committing to the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Board logistics ==<br/><br/>The board is composed of general managers and personnel directors from a number of NFL teams, along with the directors of the NFL's two scouting combines, BLESTO and The National. Before 2015 it issued an advisory opinion that a player has potential to be picked:<br/><br/><br/><br/>in the first round<br/><br/>as high as the second round<br/><br/>as high as the third round<br/><br/>after the third round<br/><br/>undrafted<br/><br/>The board has a fair track record that has successfully predicted pick placement for some underclassmen but not others. From 2012 to 2014 it accurately predicted the selections of 73.7% of the players the board graded as first-round selections, and 85.4% of the players it graded for the second, but almost 53% of those receiving third-round grades or lower were not drafted.<br/><br/>The number of underclassmen declaring for the draft rose from 56 in 2011 to 98 in 2014, setting a record each year. After 36 (37%) of those declaring in 2014 went undrafted, and eight schools had more than five underclassmen declaring, the board altered its procedure.
