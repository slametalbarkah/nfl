            The Super Bowl Experience (formerly the NFL Experience) is an annual event which has been held since 1992 at a venue in the host city of the Super Bowl. The event is described as an interactive "theme park", featuring various fan-oriented attractions, including football-related activities and autograph sessions with current and former players. Proceeds from the sale of Super Bowl Experience tickets go to fund the NFL's Youth Education Town (YET) initiative, which constructs facilities (typically in low-income neighborhoods of Super Bowl host cities) offering afterschool programs for youth. Tickets to this event are free and can be assessed at the OnePass App on the NFLs main website.<br/><br/>In November 2017, the NFL opened an NFL Experience attraction at New York City's 20 Times Square, in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil, which featured a similar array of interactive experiences and memorabilia. Consequently, the NFL began to refer to the travelling event as the Super Bowl Experience beginning in 2018 for Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. The Times Square experience was later closed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The first NFL Experience was held at the Minneapolis Convention Center in January 1992 prior to Super Bowl XXVI.  The NFL's interactive theme park was followed by Major League Baseball's first "FanFest" in San Diego, California six months later.<br/><br/>In 2013 the NFL Experience was hosted at the New Orleans Morial Convention Center.<br/><br/>The NFL Experience was not held for Super Bowl XLVIII. Instead, the NFL organized an outdoor festival, Super Bowl Boulevard, along Broadway and Times Square, which featured a similar array of fan-oriented events and attractions (such as an artificial toboggan hill).
