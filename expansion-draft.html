            An expansion draft, in professional sports, occurs when a sports league decides to create one or more new expansion teams or franchises.  This occurs mainly in North American sports and closed leagues. One of the ways of stocking the new team or teams is an expansion draft.  Although how each league conducts them varies, and they vary from occasion to occasion, the system is usually something similar to the following:<br/><br/>Each existing team is told it can "protect" a certain number of its existing contracted players by furnishing their names to the league office on or before a certain date.  The expansion team(s) then are allowed to select players not on the protected lists in a manner somewhat similar to an entry draft.  There are generally a maximum number of players that can be selected from any one team, at least without the team losing the player receiving something in compensation such as a future entry draft pick.<br/><br/>Teams subject to losing players usually tend to put most if not all of the players they truly need to stay competitive on the protected list.  This means that the expansion franchise is often left to choose among players who are old, injury prone, failing to develop as the teams had intended, or perhaps so highly compensated that a team wishes to remove them from the payroll.  For this reason, expansion teams are often noncompetitive in their early years in a league, although the advent of the free agent system has modified this somewhat. Marc-André Fleury, who won three Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins, is a notable exception of a star player in their prime being left exposed in an expansion draft, being made available for the Vegas Golden Knights in the 2017 NHL expansion draft after Fleury was made expendable due to the rise of Matt Murray at goaltender.
