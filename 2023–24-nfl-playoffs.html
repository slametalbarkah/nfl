            The National Football League playoffs for the 2023 season began on January 13, 2024, and concluded with Super Bowl LVIII on February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada with the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Francisco 49ers. This was the first postseason since 1998 not to feature either Peyton Manning or Tom Brady, as they both played their final NFL games in the 2015 and 2022 seasons, respectively.<br/><br/>In the Wild Card round, the No. 7 seed Green Bay Packers defeated the No. 2 seed Dallas Cowboys, becoming the first No. 7 seed ever to win a playoff game since the introduction of the format in 2020. The Detroit Lions won their first playoff game since 1991 by defeating the Los Angeles Rams. This was the 15th consecutive NFL postseason in which at least one team scored at least 40 points in a game (done both by Houston and Green Bay).<br/><br/>The Kansas City Chiefs became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the New England Patriots successfully did so in 2003 and 2004. They were also the first team to win the Super Bowl as a 3 seed since the 2006 Colts.
