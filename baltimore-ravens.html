            The Baltimore Ravens are a professional American football team based in Baltimore. The Ravens compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at M&amp;T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings Mills, Maryland.<br/><br/>The Baltimore Ravens were established in 1996 after Art Modell, then owner of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans in 1995 to relocate the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore. As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' history, team colors, and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would resume play in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would form an expansion team. Steve Bisciotti has been the Ravens' majority owner since 2004; the franchise was valued at $4.63 billion in 2023, making it the 28th-most valuable sports franchise in the world.<br/><br/>The Ravens have been one of the most successful NFL franchises since their inception, compiling a regular season record of 268–199–1 (.574), the highest among active franchises. They also own the fourth-highest playoff winning percentage at 18–14 (.563). The team has qualified for the NFL playoffs 16 times since 2000 with two Super Bowl titles (Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII), two AFC Championship titles (2000 and 2012), five AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2023), and eight AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019,  2023, and 2024).
