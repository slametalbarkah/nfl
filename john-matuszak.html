            John Daniel Matuszak (October 25, 1950 – June 17, 1989), nicknamed "Tooz", was an American professional football defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) who later became an actor.<br/><br/>Matuszak was drafted by the Houston Oilers with the first overall pick in the 1973 NFL draft and played most of his career with the Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders until retiring after winning his second Super Bowl in 1981. Matuszak participated in the 1978 World's Strongest Man competition, placing ninth. As an actor, he starred in both films and television, appearing first as O. W. Shaddock in North Dallas Forty (1979) followed by Tonda in Caveman (1981) and the deformed Sloth in The Goonies (1985). Matuszak's autobiography, Cruisin' with the Tooz, written with Steve Delsohn, was published in 1987.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>John Daniel Matuszak was born on October 25, 1950, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Audrey and Marvin Matuszak. He had two brothers, but both died of cystic fibrosis at young ages. One of his sisters also had the disease. The family moved from downtown Milwaukee to Oak Creek, Wisconsin, where Matuszak's classmates ridiculed him as a gawky beanpole. Their disrespect motivated Matuszak to develop into a muscular young man, and he became the Wisconsin Class A state champion in the shot put with a throw of 58 ft 11 in (17.96 m).
