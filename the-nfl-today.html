            The NFL Today is an American football television program on CBS that serves as the pre-game show for the network's National Football League (NFL) game telecasts under the NFL on CBS brand. The program features commentary on the latest news around the NFL from its hosts and studio analysts, as well as predictions for the day's games and interviews with players and coaches. Originally debuting as Pro Football Kickoff on September 17, 1961, the program airs before all NFL games broadcast by CBS (usually on Sundays at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Zone), and generally runs for one hour (except for Thanksgiving and during the postseason when it is generally 30 minutes). The program's commentators also provide commentary during game updates, the halftime reports, and the postgame show on the NFL on CBS broadcasts at the conclusion of single early games and, if time permits, late games.<br/><br/>Since 2024, the crew consists of longtime sportscaster James Brown, who has served as the host of The NFL Today since 2006; former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher; former Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions wide receiver Nate Burleson; Houston Texans former defensive end J. J. Watt; and Atlanta Falcons former quarterback Matt Ryan serving as analysts.<br/><br/>The NFL Today broadcasts from Studio 43 at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City; however, the program will occasionally broadcast from the game site for the AFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl. The pregame telecast of the Super Bowl has sometimes been branded as The Super Bowl Today.<br/><br/>From 2014 to 2017, CBS partnered with the NFL Network to air selected Thursday Night Football games; the NFL GameDay crew has appeared in segments on The NFL Today for both Thursdays and Sundays (and Saturdays when applicable).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Broadcast history ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Dawn of the pregame format (1961–1974) ===<br/><br/>The program began on September 17, 1961, when CBS debuted the first remote 15-minute pre-game show, the first of its kind on network sports television.
