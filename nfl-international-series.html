            The NFL International Series is a series of American football games during the National Football League (NFL) regular season that are played outside the United States. The series has several sub-series: the NFL London Games in the United Kingdom, which have been in place since 2007; the NFL Germany Games in multiple cities, the NFL Brazil Games in São Paulo, as well as the future NFL Madrid Game in Spain, the future NFL Dublin Game in Ireland, and the future NFL Melbourne Game in Australia. Between 2016 and 2022, the series also intermittently included games played in Mexico. <br/><br/>Wembley Stadium in London was the exclusive home stadium for International Series games from 2007 to 2015 and continued to host NFL games through 2019 and again from 2022; beginning in 2016, the series expanded to more stadiums, first to Twickenham Stadium in London (2016–17) and to Estadio Azteca in Mexico City (2016–17, 2019, 2022) and eventually to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London (2019, 2021–29), three locations in Germany: the Allianz Arena in Munich (2022 and 2024), Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt (2023), and the Olympiastadion in Berlin (2025), Arena Corinthians in São Paulo (2024–25), Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, Spain, Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland (2025), and the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia (2026).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Before 2005, the National Football League (NFL)'s primary method of promoting its game abroad was through the American Bowl, a series of preseason games played around the world, and NFL Europe, a developmental league based in Europe. The American Bowls ended in 2005 (though a similar China Bowl was planned for 2007 before being canceled), while NFL Europa (as it was known for its final season) folded in 2007. On October 2, 2005, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 31–14 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico, under the name "NFL Fútbol Americano". It was the first regular season NFL game held outside the United States. The game drew the NFL's highest game attendance at the time with 103,467 spectators.<br/><br/>Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL, considered expanding the league's appeal overseas ever since the end of NFL Europe.
