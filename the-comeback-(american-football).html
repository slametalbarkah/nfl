            The Comeback or The Choke was a National Football League (NFL) game held on January 3, 1993, as part of the 1992–93 NFL playoffs. The Buffalo Bills overcame a 35–3 deficit to defeat the visiting Houston Oilers 41–38 in overtime and set the then-record for largest comeback in NFL history. Though surpassed by the Minnesota Vikings in 2022, the Bills' 32-point comeback remains the largest comeback in postseason history and the second largest overall. It was also the first time an NFL team with a lead of at least 30 points lost the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Before this game, the only time in NFL history that a team failed to win a game that they led by 30 or more points in was a 38–38 tie in a 1960 game between the Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos, in which the Broncos rallied from a 38–7 deficit to tie the game at 38, which would end up being the final score.<br/><br/>Both teams qualified for the playoffs as wild card teams, with Buffalo as the fourth seed and Houston as the fifth seed.<br/><br/>The Buffalo Bills, the American Football Conference (AFC) champions for the previous two seasons, recorded an 11–5 record during the 1992 regular season and finished in second place in the AFC Eastern Division. Buffalo's no-huddle offense led the league in rushing yards (2,436) and ranked second in the league in total offensive yards (6,114 yards). The main keys to their success were their four future Hall of Fame players on offense: Quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas, and receivers Andre Reed and James Lofton. Buffalo also had a Hall of Fame defensive end, Bruce Smith, who went on to become the NFL's all-time leader in sacks.
