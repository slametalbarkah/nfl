            In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game occurs when a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score after one 10-minute overtime period. Ties have counted as a half-win and half-loss in league standings since 1972; before that, ties were not counted in the standings at all. Tie games were once frequent in the NFL, but have become increasingly uncommon due to a rule change in 1974 that extended the existing sudden-death overtime for post-season games into the regular season. As a result, ties are most often the result of mishaps or mistakes from the teams involved. Tied games are considered to be the least desired outcome a football game can produce.<br/><br/>From 1920 to 1973, there were a total of 256 tied games. Only three seasons prior to the rule change went without a tied game, while five seasons had at least ten ties. The most ties, 17, occurred in the 1920 season. Since overtime was introduced in 1974, there have been 29 tied games. The most ties recorded in a season since the introduction of overtime is two; this has happened in five seasons (1986, 1997, 2016, 2018, and 2022).
