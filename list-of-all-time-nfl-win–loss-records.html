            The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league, which as of the end of its 2024 season, consists of 32 teams. These teams are divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC), and both conferences contain four divisions with four teams each. Since its formation in 1920, as the American Professional Football Association (APFA), NFL game results have been recorded. Games in the NFL can either end with a winner and a loser, or the two teams can tie. The NFL officially counts ties in its standings; ties are registered as a half-win and a half-loss when calculating the win–loss percentage. However, this method of assessing ties in the win–loss percentage has only been in place since the 1972 season, meaning all ties prior do not affect a team's win percentage.<br/><br/>One of only two charter members of the NFL still in existence, the Chicago Bears have played the most games (1,486) and recorded the most ties (42) in NFL regular season history. Their NFC North divisional rivals, the Green Bay Packers have recorded the most wins (810) in NFL history. The league's other still-active charter member, the Arizona Cardinals, have recorded the most regular season losses (812), through the end of the 2024 season. The Baltimore Ravens hold the highest regular season win–loss percentage (.574), with a 268–199–1 record through the end of the 2024 season.
