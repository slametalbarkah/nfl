<h1>List of highest-scoring NFL games</h1>
            
            This is a list of the highest-scoring games in the history of the National Football League, by number of combined points. It includes both regular season and postseason games. The highest-scoring game overall was a 1966 game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants, which produced a combined 113 points with a score of 72-41. The most points scored by one team in a single game is the 73 the Chicago Bears scored in the 1940 NFL Championship Game, which is not included on this list, as their opponents scored zero additional points. It also serves as the game with the largest margin of victory in NFL history. <br/><br/>Scoring can be achieved through touchdowns (6 points), point after touchdown (1 point), two-point conversion (2 points), a safety (1–2 points) or a field goal (3 points). In the event of a  tie after four quarters, the overtime period allows scores to increase further as teams try to win it out of regulation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Scores ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Regular season ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Playoffs ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Super Bowl ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Game notes ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Regular season ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== 113 points (New York Giants vs. Washington Redskins, 1966) ====<br/><br/>The Washington Redskins and the New York Giants combined for a total of 113 points in one game on November 27, 1966, in Washington, D.C.
