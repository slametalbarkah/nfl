            The UC Davis Aggies football team represents the University of California, Davis in NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The football program's first season took place in 1915, and has fielded a team each year since with the exception of 1918 during World War I and from 1943 to 1945 during World War II, when the campus, then known as the University Farm, was shut down. The team was known as the Cal Aggies or California Aggies from 1922 to 1958 when UC Davis was called the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture.<br/><br/>UC Davis competed as a member of the NCAA College Division through 1972; from 1973 to 2003, the Aggies competed as an NCAA Division II program. In 2004, UC Davis promoted its football program to the Division I FCS (then I-AA) level and joined the Great West Conference (then known as the Great West Football Conference) after one season as an independent team with exploratory status. After their provisional seasons and the construction of a new stadium, UC Davis became a full member of Division I in 2007 and eligible for the postseason.<br/><br/>Throughout its history, the football program won 31 conference championships. Between 1929 and 1992, the Aggies captured 27 outright or shared Northern California Athletic Conference championships, including 20 in a row from 1971 to 1990, an American West Conference title in 1993 (co-champion), and GWFC/GWC championships in 2005 (co-champ) and 2009.<br/><br/>The Aggies won their first conference title as a Division I program in 2018 as one of the Big Sky Conference's three regular-season champions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Conference affiliations ==<br/><br/>UC Davis has been both independent and affiliated with multiple conferences.: 46 <br/><br/><br/><br/>NCAA Independent (1915–1924)<br/><br/>Northern California Athletic Conference (1925–1992)<br/><br/>Far Western Conference (1925–1981)<br/><br/>Northern California Athletic Conference (1982–1992)<br/><br/>American West Conference (1993)<br/><br/>NCAA Division II independent (1994–2002)<br/><br/>NCAA Division I-AA independent (2003)<br/><br/>Great West Football Conference (2004–2011)<br/><br/>Big Sky Conference (2012–present)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Conference championships ==<br/><br/>UC Davis Aggies football program has won or shared a total of 31 conference championships since 1915, including 27 from the Northern California Athletic Conference where they won 20 straight conference champions from 1971 to 1990.
