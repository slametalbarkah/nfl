            Super Bowl LI was an American football game played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 5, 2017, to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2016 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34–28 in overtime. Super Bowl LI featured the largest comeback in Super Bowl history, with the Patriots overcoming a 3-28 deficit to emerge victorious. The game was also the first Super Bowl to be decided in overtime.<br/><br/>The Patriots' victory was their fifth, moving them into a three-way tie with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl wins. After finishing the regular season with a league-best 14–2 record, New England advanced to their record-setting ninth Super Bowl appearance and their seventh under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Falcons, led by the league's top offense and MVP quarterback Matt Ryan, finished the regular season with an 11–5 record, the second best record in the NFC, and were seeking their first Super Bowl title in their second appearance.<br/><br/>Atlanta scored three consecutive touchdowns to take a 3-21 halftime lead, which they increased to 3-28 midway through the third quarter. However, the Patriots scored 25 consecutive points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In overtime, New England received the kickoff after winning the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim the title.
