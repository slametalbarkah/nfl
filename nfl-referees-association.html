            The National Football League Referees Association (NFLRA), established in 1972 as the Professional Football Referees Association is a labor union that serves as the collective bargaining agency for game officials with the National Football League (NFL).<br/><br/>The NFLRA has been involved in two work stoppages, lock outs taking place in 2001 and 2012.
