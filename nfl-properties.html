<h1>NFL Properties</h1>
            
            NFL Properties is the merchandising and licensing arm of the National Football League (NFL). The subsidiary of the league was founded in 1963 to maintain control of the brands of the league and its franchises and to license and negotiate with vendors to create official NFL merchandise. The NFL Properties head office is located in New York City.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Team NFL Heroes "mascot" program ==<br/><br/>A line of mascot-like characters representing each team in the NFL was developed by NFL Properties in the early 1990s. Named "Team NFL Heroes", various types of merchandise such as stuffed dolls, school supplies, t-shirts, and lamps featuring the characters were manufactured and marketed mainly to children and teenagers. Mascot costumes of each character were created and people wearing these costumes made an appearance at the 1995 Pro Bowl. (Pictures of the costumes at the game can be seen online.)  Most of the Team NFL Heroes characters only lasted a season or two but a handful ended up being adopted as official mascots by their respective teams, either immediately after the Team NFL Heroes project was canceled or years later; Revere, the New England Patriots Team NFL Hero (name later changed to Pat Patriot after becoming the team's live mascot), is an example of the former while Miles the Denver Broncos Team NFL Hero is an example of the latter.<br/><br/>During the Team NFL Heroes campaign the Green Bay Packers had a bear for a mascot despite their arch rivals being the Chicago Bears.  Specifically a polar bear, the Packers' Team NFL Hero's name was "Bayer", a play on Green Bayer (meaning a citizen of Green Bay, Wisconsin) while simultaneously being a homonym of "bear".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Comic books ==<br/><br/>The NFL branched out into comic books in the early 1990s when Marvel Comics created the character NFL SuperPro.
