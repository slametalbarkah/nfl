            Laremy Alexander Tunsil (born August 2, 1994) is an American professional football offensive tackle for the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the 2016 NFL draft. Tunsil was traded to the Houston Texans in 2019, earning five Pro Bowls honors before being traded to the Commanders in 2025.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Tunsil was born on August 2, 1994, in Harvey, Louisiana. He grew up in Lake City, Florida, attending Columbia High School where he played football and competed in track and field as a shot putter. He was a two-time All-State offensive lineman for the Tigers football team. Tunsil credits his development as an offensive tackle to going up against defensive lineman Timmy Jernigan, his Columbia teammate, in practice. "He's always trying to get better every day. He's strong and he's fundamentally sound. He's got all the tools you need to be one of the best," said his high school coach Brian Allen.
