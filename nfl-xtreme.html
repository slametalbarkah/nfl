            NFL Xtreme is an American football video game developed by 989 Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game was intended to be a competitor to Midway Games' NFL Blitz series. The gameplay is similar to the style of NFL Blitz, but is more of a casual gamer / arcade version of NFL Gameday '98, like NFL Tour ('08, the "next gen" NFL Street) and Madden NFL 08 respectively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Gameplay ==<br/><br/>Unlike real football, each game is a five-on-five matchup and every player is an eligible receiver. In addition, there are no boundaries or penalties, and a first down is 20 yards.<br/><br/>The game also offers standard football video game features such as create-a-player, draft picks, and season play, and includes full NFL licensing with real NFL teams and schedules.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Development ==<br/><br/>NFL Xtreme was built on the same game engine as NFL Gameday '98. However, because the game uses a much smaller number of players - five on each side - the developers were able to use more polygons in each player without taxing the hardware, allowing more detailed players.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Reception ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Next Generation said that the game was "no NFL Blitz.
