<h1>99-yard pass play</h1>
            
            A 99-yard pass play is the longest play involving a forward pass that is possible in an American football game. It gains 99 yards and scores a touchdown for the offensive team. The play has occurred thirteen times in NFL history, most recently by Eli Manning and Victor Cruz. The Washington Commanders are the only team to have had multiple 99 yard passes, having done so three times. They were also the first franchise to complete one, accomplishing the feat in 1939. The Chicago Bears are the only team to have given up multiple 99-yard passes, doing so three times. Teams that have had a 99-yard pass play are 10–3 in the game it occurred in.<br/><br/>In addition to 99-yard pass plays, there have been two NFL 99-yard running plays, by Tony Dorsett and Derrick Henry.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Details ==<br/><br/>A 99-yard pass play starts with the line of scrimmage at the offensive team's one-yard line. The quarterback receives the ball, passes it and completes a forward pass, which is then carried for a touchdown at the other end of the field.
