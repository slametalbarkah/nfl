            As with all sports leagues, there are several significant rivalries between teams and notable players in the National Football League (NFL). Rivalries are occasionally created due to a particular event that causes bad blood between teams, players, coaches, or owners, but for the most part, they arise simply due to the frequency with which some teams play each other and sometimes exist for geographic reasons.<br/><br/>Rivalries in the NFL are commonly recognized as such by fans and players alike. While many rivalries are well established, others are of more recent vintage, accepted as existing by the nature of the competition and history between the two teams. Other rivalries have fallen by the wayside due to league realignment and a reduction in frequency of meetings. Many modern rivalries are formed simply due to the two teams being within the same division.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Foundation ==<br/><br/>Purely geographic rivalries are rare in the NFL, since crosstown rivals do not play each other nearly as often as in other leagues that have more games and place teams closest to each other into the same divisions (and therefore more opportunities to play other teams).<br/><br/>For example, until the 2022 season, Major League Baseball teams face each league opponent at least six times in the regular season, and within a division as many as 19 times, while the National Hockey League scheduling policies in the 21st century ensured at least eight games (out of 82) with division rivals and ensured the two areas with multiple teams (New York and Los Angeles) had all of the teams in one area in the same division. In recent years, the NFL changed its scheduling formula to ensure every possible matchup happens within four years, excluding pre-season games or the Super Bowl.<br/><br/>A main factor in the fact that crosstown rivals are almost always in opposing conferences is because of history: in the two current markets (New York/New Jersey and Los Angeles) that have two NFL teams, both have one team that was a member of the American Football League (the Jets in New York/New Jersey and Chargers in Los Angeles).
