            The NFL on Nickelodeon is the branding used for broadcasts of National Football League (NFL) games that are produced by CBS Sports, and broadcast on the American pay television channel Nickelodeon. In 2021, Nickelodeon hosted a one-time simulcast in coordination with CBS of the Chicago Bears–New Orleans Saints Wild Card game. This marked the first time that a major live sporting event would be broadcast on the channel. Following positive reception from media and fans, Nickelodeon announced that the simulcast would return for a Wild Card game during the 2021–22 NFL playoffs between the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys. In May 2022, Nickelodeon announced that the simulcast would return for a Christmas game during the 2022 NFL season between the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams. In May 2023, Nickelodeon announced that the simulcast would return for a second consecutive Christmas game during the 2023 NFL season between the Las Vegas Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs. In August 2023, CBS announced that it would carry Super Bowl LVIII on Nickelodeon in the same format, marking the second time that a Super Bowl game featured a second English language broadcast, after Super Bowl I. In August 2024, CBS announced that Nickelodeon would carry another Wild Card game during the 2024–25 NFL playoffs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== List of televised games ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In December 2019, Viacom re-merged with CBS Corporation to form ViacomCBS. To capitalize on the re-merger, CBS announced plans to add content from Nickelodeon to its CBS All Access streaming service. Additionally, the National Football League announced that Nickelodeon would air a youth-specific broadcast of an early 2021 Wild Card playoff game that CBS Sports acquired the rights to, marking the first major live sporting event on the channel. The idea for Nickelodeon to televise an NFL game was that of CBS Sports' chairman Sean McManus.
