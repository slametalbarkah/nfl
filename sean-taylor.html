He was selected fifth overall in the 2004 NFL draft by the Redskins, where he played four seasons until his murder in 2007.<br/><br/>As a high school player, Taylor led Gulliver Prep to a Florida state championship and set the state record for single-season touchdowns. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, where he was a member of their 2001 BCS National Championship team and won the Jack Tatum Trophy. With the Redskins, he gained a reputation as a hard-hitting player and was nicknamed "Meast" from the expression "half man, half beast." He made one Pro Bowl appearance in 2006.<br/><br/>During the 2007 season, Taylor was shot by intruders at his Miami area home and died the next day on November 27. Posthumously, he earned a second Pro Bowl selection and second-team All-Pro honors. Taylor was inducted to Washington's Ring of Fame in 2008.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Taylor was born in Florida City, Florida, on April 1, 1983. He spent his early years growing up with his great-grandmother in Homestead, Florida and later moved to his father's home at the age of 11.
