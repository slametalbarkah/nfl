<h1>List of NFL awards</h1>
            
            In the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in North America, there are a variety of awards presented to recognize players and teams for outstanding achievements. Each year on the night before the Super Bowl, the NFL Honors ceremony is held to present many of the league's most prestigious awards. In addition to these awards, there are many other organizations that present their own awards after each NFL season, often accompanied by a banquet and other festivities. Because of this, there is a much wider range of awards recognized in football compared to that of other major North American sports.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Team awards ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Vince Lombardi Trophy ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Vince Lombardi Trophy is awarded to the winning team of each season's Super Bowl, the NFL's championship game. The original trophy, designed by jewelry retailer Tiffany &amp; Co., was awarded in 1967 to the winner of the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I. It was named in 1970 in honor of longtime Green Bay Packers head coach, Vince Lombardi.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== George Halas Trophy ===<br/><br/>The George Halas Trophy is awarded each season to the National Football Conference (NFC) champion, i.e., the winner of that season's NFC Championship Game. It is named after the founder, owner, and longtime head coach of the Chicago Bears, George Halas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Lamar Hunt Trophy ===<br/><br/>The Lamar Hunt Trophy is awarded each season to the American Football Conference (AFC) champion, i.e., the winner of that season's AFC Championship Game. It is named in honor of Lamar Hunt, the founder of the Kansas City Chiefs.
