            The Dallas Texans played in the National Football League (NFL) for one season in 1952. They posted a record of 1–11.<br/><br/>Initially based in Dallas, the team was returned to the league in the middle of the season and became a traveling team based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Akron, Ohio. <br/><br/>Professional football returned to Dallas in 1960, as the American Football League (AFL) commenced operations with one of its eight charter members in Dallas, also called the Texans, while the NFL added the Dallas Cowboys. The AFL Dallas Texans would later move to Kansas City, Missouri, and be re-branded as the "Chiefs" in 1963.<br/><br/>After the team folded, the league awarded its assets to the new Baltimore Colts, who retained the team's blue-and-white colors. However, neither the Colts nor the NFL recognize the Texans or their previous incarnations dating back to 1944 as part of the Colts' legacy. Thus, as of 2025, the Dallas Texans are the most recent NFL team to fold and not have its legacy included in that of any other team.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>After the 1951 season, the financially troubled New York Yanks franchise was put on the market by Ted Collins, who had founded the franchise in 1944 as the Boston Yanks before moving it to New York City in 1949, rebranding them as the Bulldogs, and rebranded it again as the Yanks in 1950. After failing to find a buyer, Collins sold the team back to the League.
