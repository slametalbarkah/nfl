            The Houston Oilers were a professional American football team that played in Houston, Texas, from its founding in 1960 to 1996. The Houston Oilers began play as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) and won two AFL championships before joining the NFL in the AFL–NFL merger of the late 1960s. <br/><br/>The Houston Oilers competed in the AFL's East division—along with the Buffalo Bills, the New York Jets and the Boston Patriots—until the merger, when they joined the newly formed AFC Central. The team played home games at Jeppesen Stadium and Rice Stadium during its first eight seasons, and thereafter at the Astrodome. <br/><br/>The Houston Oilers were the first champions of the American Football League, winning the 1960 and 1961 championships, but never won another. The Houston Oilers appeared in the 1962 AFL Championship, losing in double overtime to their in-state rivals, the Dallas Texans (now the Kansas City Chiefs); they also won the AFL East Division title in 1967 and qualified for the AFL Playoffs in 1969, both times losing to the Oakland Raiders (which are now the Las Vegas Raiders). From 1978 to 1980, the Houston Oilers, led by Bum Phillips and in the midst of the Luv Ya Blue campaign, appeared in and lost the 1978 and 1979 AFC Championship Games. The Oilers were a consistent playoff team from 1987 to 1993, an era that included both of the team's only division titles (1991 and 1993), as well as the dubious distinction of being on the losing end of the second largest comeback in NFL history. For the rest of the Oilers' time in Houston, they compiled losing seasons in almost every other year.<br/><br/>The Houston Oilers' main colors were Columbia blue and white, with scarlet trim, while their logo was a simple derrick.
