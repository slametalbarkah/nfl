            NFL '95 is the sixth video game in the Joe Montana Football/NFL series. It is the last Sega football game to feature Joe Montana. Its sequel, Prime Time NFL Football, featured Deion Sanders.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Summary ==<br/><br/>This video game is similar to the previous, NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana, except in this version, there is no play by play commentary. The rosters of the NFL teams are updated to reflect the 1994 NFL season, and there are more plays for the player's football team to perform on offense and defense. Once again, Joe Montana appears on the title screen.<br/><br/>Despite the updated rosters, the game is notable in that it still had Deion Sanders as a member of the Atlanta Falcons instead of the San Francisco 49ers, with whom Sanders signed as a free agent during the offseason. The 49ers went on to win Super Bowl XXIX in Sanders' only season with the team before signing with the rival Dallas Cowboys the following offseason.<br/><br/>The game featured Free Agency (which was introduced to the NFL a year prior to this game's release) and varied in-game music.<br/><br/>The game was followed by similar releases, Prime Time NFL Football Starring Deion Sanders, NFL '97 and NFL 98.
