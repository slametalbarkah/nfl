            Kordell Stewart (born October 16, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Nicknamed "Slash", he played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes and achieved recognition as a senior for the "Miracle at Michigan", a Hail Mary pass he completed to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. He was selected by the Steelers in the second round of the 1995 NFL draft.<br/><br/>Stewart held a variety of roles for the Steelers before becoming their starting quarterback in 1997, which saw him help guide the team to an AFC Championship Game appearance. His most successful season was in 2001 where he led Pittsburgh to the conference's top seed and a return to the conference championship, while earning Pro Bowl and AFC Offensive Player of the Year honors. Stewart's performance declined the following year, resulting in him being released by the Steelers. Afterwards, Stewart played one season for the Chicago Bears and held a backup role during two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens. He ranks sixth in quarterback rushing touchdowns at 38.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Kordell Stewart was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended John Ehret High School in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
