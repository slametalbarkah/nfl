            The 1987 NFL season was the 68th regular season of the National Football League (NFL).  This season featured games predominantly played by replacement players, as the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA)  players were on strike from weeks four to six with week three being cancelled in its entirety. This remains the last NFL season in which regular-season games were impacted by a labor conflict (as well as the last season when non-union players were used as strikebreaking competitors).<br/><br/>The season ended with Super Bowl XXII, with the Washington Redskins defeating the Denver Broncos, 42–10, at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego. The Broncos suffered their second consecutive Super Bowl defeat.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Player movement ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Transactions ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Trades ===<br/><br/>On October 31, 1987, the Los Angeles Rams traded Eric Dickerson to the Indianapolis Colts in a three-team trade involving the Buffalo Bills. The Rams sent Dickerson to the Colts for six draft choices and two players. Buffalo obtained the rights to Cornelius Bennett from Indianapolis. Buffalo sent running back Greg Bell and three draft choices to the Rams, while Indianapolis added Owen Gill and three of their own draft picks to complete the deal with the Rams.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Draft ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The 1987 NFL Draft was held from April 28 to 29, 1987, at New York City's Marriott Marquis.
