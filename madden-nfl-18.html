            Madden NFL 18 is an American football sports video game based on the National Football League, developed and published by EA Sports for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The 29th installment of the Madden NFL series, the game features New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady on the cover, the second straight year a Patriots player has had the distinction, following tight end Rob Gronkowski. <br/><br/>It was released worldwide on August 25, 2017, while those who pre-ordered the "G.O.A.T. Edition" were able to play it three days earlier and access their copy on August 22, 2017. It is the first game of the series since Madden NFL 06 not to be released on Xbox 360 and the first game since Madden NFL 07 not to be released on PlayStation 3, and also the first game in the main series to be available on only two platforms since Madden NFL '94.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Gameplay ==<br/><br/>Madden NFL 18 is the first game in the series to use the Frostbite engine.<br/><br/>While the Madden series has typically featured a Superstar career mode, Madden NFL 18 introduces a story mode known as Longshot, the first such mode in the series. Longshot follows Devin Wade, a quarterback from Mathis, Texas, as he tries to reach the NFL, and includes high school and college football games (the first appearance of the latter in an EA Sports game since 2013, when EA ended the NCAA Football series), as well as the NFL Scouting Combine. The player's decisions and performances in the game determine Devin's career path, as dialog trees are used to help him make decisions.<br/><br/>Madden NFL 18 also included many subtle game-play changes. One of the major changes was a new element to the overall difficulty of a game, introducing "game styles".
