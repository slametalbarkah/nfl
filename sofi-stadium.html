            SoFi Stadium ( SOH-fy) is a 70,240-seat sports and entertainment indoor-outdoor stadium in Inglewood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. SoFi occupies the former site of the Hollywood Park Racetrack, 0.15 miles (0.24 km) southeast of the Kia Forum, 0.2 miles (0.32 km) northwest of Intuit Dome, and 4 miles (6.4 km) from Los Angeles International Airport.<br/><br/>Opened in September 2020, the fixed-roof stadium is home to the National Football League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, as well as the annual LA Bowl in college football. The stadium hosted Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship, WrestleMania 39, and the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup final. It is scheduled to host eight matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl LXI in 2027, and the opening ceremony and swimming events for the 2028 Summer Olympics.<br/><br/>The stadium complex is a component of Hollywood Park, a master planned neighborhood in development on the site of the former racetrack. Hollywood Park Casino re-opened in a new building on the property in October 2016, becoming the development's first establishment to open.<br/><br/>SoFi Stadium is one of two stadiums currently shared by a pair of NFL teams, the other being MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, shared by the New York Giants and New York Jets. It is the first stadium complex outside of the New York metropolitan area to host two NFL teams concurrently; the other three since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger have been Shea Stadium, Giants Stadium and MetLife Stadium. It is the fourth stadium complex in Greater Los Angeles shared by more than one team from the same league.
