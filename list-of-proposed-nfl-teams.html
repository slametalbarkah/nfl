<h1>List of proposed NFL teams</h1>
            
            The formation and evolution of National Football League (NFL) teams have been shaped by a combination of expansions, relocations, and mergers. Established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, the NFL began with 14 teams, many of which were rooted in small towns and industrial cities. As the popularity of American football grew, the league strategically expanded to incorporate teams from larger markets. Notable expansions include the addition of the Minnesota Vikings in 1961 and the Atlanta Falcons in 1966.<br/><br/>Relocation has also played a significant role in the NFL's history, with teams moving to new cities to access larger markets, modern facilities, or more favorable economic conditions. For instance, the Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles in 1946, becoming the first NFL team on the West Coast. The Oakland Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, returned to Oakland in 1995, and later moved to Las Vegas in 2020. Similarly, the St. Louis Cardinals moved to Arizona in 1988, becoming the Phoenix (now Arizona) Cardinals.<br/><br/>Mergers have further shaped the league's structure.
