            In the National Football League (NFL), the team captain designation is a team-appointed position that designates certain players as leaders on and off the field. The captains program was implemented by the NFL Player Advisory Council established by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in conjunction with the NFL Players Association. Starting in 2007, the league began permitting teams to name up to six players as captains.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Rules ==<br/><br/>NFL rule 18 details the guidelines for team captains. Within Rule 18, there are four articles that pertain to:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Number of team captains<br/><br/>Coin toss procedures<br/><br/>Choice on penalty option<br/><br/>Change of [team] captains<br/><br/>Coin toss procedures – Each team can send as many as six team captains to the center of the field. On each team, one captain is designated the "speaking captain" of the delegation. The visiting team or the team designated "visitor" by the referee (if no team is declared 'visitor') shall choose "heads or tails" or in the case of a special ceremony coin, the options on the face and rear of that coin.<br/><br/>After the winning captain makes their choice, the opposing team captain chooses from the remaining two options.<br/><br/>Choice on penalty option(s) – The offended team captain has a choice of accepting a penalty enforcement or declining, except where said penalty is automatically "enforced by rule". In some circumstances, a team captain may elect to "decline" the penalty.
