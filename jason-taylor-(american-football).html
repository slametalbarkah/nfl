            Jason Paul Taylor (born September 1, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end and linebacker in the National Football League (NFL), spending the majority of his career with the Miami Dolphins. He is currently the defensive ends coach for the Miami Hurricanes. Over the course of his 15-year NFL career, Taylor played for the Dolphins for 13 years in three separate stints (1997–2007, 2009, 2011), and also played a season each for the Washington Redskins (2008) and the New York Jets (2010).<br/><br/>Taylor was a four-year letterman and three-year starter playing college football for the Akron Zips before being selected by the Dolphins in the third round of the 1997 NFL draft with the 73rd overall pick.<br/><br/>Taylor won the Dolphins Team Newcomer of the Year award during his rookie season in 1997, and from then on, quickly established himself as one of the league's best performing defensive ends and pass-rushers in NFL history. He is currently ranked first in Dolphins history for the most games played by a defensive player in team history, with 204 games (including a defensive team record 130 consecutive games), and is also the Miami Dolphins all-time sack leader with 131 sacks. Overall, Taylor is currently 7th on the NFL all-time career sacks list with 139.5 sacks. Taylor has the 4th most forced fumbles of all time with 46, and is the all-time leader in fumble return touchdowns with six, and interceptions returned for touchdowns by a defensive lineman with three, while his 246 fumble return yards are the 4th-highest total in NFL history. With nine career defensive touchdowns scored, he is also the all-time leader in that category for defensive linemen. He officially announced his retirement on December 28, 2011.
