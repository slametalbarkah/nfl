            DeAndre Rashaun Hopkins (born June 6, 1992), nicknamed "DHop" and "Nuk", is an American professional football wide receiver for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Clemson Tigers and was selected by the Houston Texans in the first round of the 2013 NFL draft. He has also played in the NFL for the Arizona Cardinals, Tennessee Titans, and Kansas City Chiefs. Hopkins is a five-time Pro Bowler and has been named to five All-Pro teams.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>As an infant, Hopkins was given the nickname Nuk by his mother because he frequently chewed through  NUK pacifiers. It is pronounced "nuke" (although the pacifier brand is pronounced "nook").<br/><br/>Hopkins attended D. W. Daniel High School in Central, South Carolina, where he played football, basketball, and ran track and field for the Lions athletic teams. During his high school football career, Hopkins had 57 receptions for 1,266 yards and 18 touchdowns on offense and 28 interceptions and five touchdowns on defense. While on the basketball team, he played as a shooting guard and point guard, scoring 1,453 career points. His senior season, 2009–10, the Lions won their third South Carolina State Championship, and Hopkins was named the Independent Mail's player of the year.
