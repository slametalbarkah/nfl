<h1>International Player Pathway</h1>
            
            International Player Pathway (IPP) is a program run by the National Football League (NFL) to increase the number of players from outside the United States or Canada in the NFL. The program was formed as part of the NFL's strategy to grow globally as it provides athletes with the opportunity to play in the league. Its aim is to increase the pool of talent and ultimately drive global fan growth.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>The International Player Pathway (IPP) program was not the first initiative by the NFL to introduce foreign talent into its pool of players and neither is it, as yet, the longest running. The first such program was the NFL International Development Practice Squad Program that ran between 2004 and 2009. Following a short hiatus of seven years there was a single incarnation of NFL Undiscovered in 2016 and building immediately on the success of that trial the IPPP was instituted in 2017.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== NFL International Development Practice Squad Program ===<br/><br/>The NFL International Practice Squad Program was an initiative run by the NFL in which selected players from outside the United States or Canada were assigned to the practice squads of NFL teams. The program began in 2004 and was concluded five years later in 2009 but during that time many players from a multitude of nations were given the opportunity to play in the NFL or other professional football leagues like the Arena Football League, the United Football League and the Canadian Football League.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== NFL Undiscovered ===<br/><br/>Two British-born former NFL players, Aden Durde (NFLUK head of football development) and two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora, were concerned that there were no clear pathways into the NFL for players who had not gone to high school and/or college in the United States, and, as a result, the NFL was potentially missing out on some exceptional players. Wanting to remedy this, in early 2016, they used their personal and professional contacts from their time in the NFL to create a training program and to set up meetings and tryouts with NFL teams for a small number of specially selected football players. These players' potential had been scouted primarily by watching YouTube videos.
