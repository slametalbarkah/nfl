            NFL playoff results is a listing of the year-by-year results of the NFL Playoff games to determine the final two teams for the championship game. The winners of those games are listed in NFL Championship Game article. The overall franchise records are shown in the last table.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== NFL playoff game results 1933–1966 ==<br/><br/>Beginning with the 1933 season, the NFL featured a championship game, played between the winners of its two divisions.  In this era, if there was a tie for first place in the division at the end of the regular season, a one-game playoff was used to determine the team that would represent their division in the NFL Championship Game.  This happened nine times during this era.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Teams who went on to win the NFL Championship Game that season are in bold.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== NFL Conference Championship game results 1967–1969 ==<br/><br/>For the 1967 season, the NFL split into four divisions (two conferences of two divisions each).  Each of the four division champions played in their respective Conference Championship Game, with those winners advancing to the NFL Championship Game.  1967 was the first year where a pre-scheduled playoff (rather than regular season results) determined participation in the championship.
