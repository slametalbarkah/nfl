            Odell Cornelious Beckham Jr. (born November 5, 1992), commonly known by his initials OBJ, is an American professional football wide receiver. He played college football for the LSU Tigers and was selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft. He has played in the NFL for the Giants, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams, Baltimore Ravens, and Miami Dolphins.<br/><br/>Beckham started the 2012 BCS National Championship Game in his first year playing at LSU, and won the Paul Hornung Award following his junior season in 2013. In his first season with the Giants, Beckham broke numerous NFL rookie receiving records, despite missing the first four games of the season due to injury. Beckham became the first player to record more than 75 receptions, 1,100 yards, and ten touchdowns in a rookie season, and broke the rookie record for the most average receiving yards per game. During Week 12 of his first season, Beckham came to national attention when he made a one-handed touchdown catch while falling backwards in a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, which numerous pundits and athletes called the greatest catch ever made. Beckham won the 2014 Offensive Rookie of the Year award.<br/><br/>In 2016, he became the fastest player in NFL history to reach both 200 career receptions and 4,000 career receiving yards.
