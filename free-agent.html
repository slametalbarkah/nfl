<h1>Free agent</h1>
            
            In professional sports, a free agent is a player or manager who is eligible to sign with other clubs or franchises; i.e., not under contract to any specific team.  The term is also used in reference to a player who is under a contract at present but who is allowed to solicit offers from other teams. In some circumstances, the free agent's options are limited by the league's rules.<br/><br/>Free agency was severely restricted in many sports leagues, instead clubs had a reserve clause which allowed them to retain players indefinitely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Usage ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Association football ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>In professional association football, a free agent is either a player that has been released by a professional association football club and now is no longer affiliated with any league, or a player whose contract with their current club has expired and is thus free to join any other club under the terms of the Bosman ruling.<br/><br/>Free agents do not have to be signed during the normal transfer window that is implemented in some countries' leagues. If they are signed by a team, the team signing them does not have to pay any fees – sometimes this is known as "a free transfer".<br/><br/>If a player is released from their club when the transfer window is closed, they cannot sign for another team until the window reopens.  A notable case of this being Sol Campbell who in September 2009 was released from Notts County, just after a month from signing on a free transfer.  He signed for his former club Arsenal in January 2010 during the winter transfer window, after spending a few months training with the team to maintain his fitness.
