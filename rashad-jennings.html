            Rashad Andre Jennings (born March 26, 1985) is an American former professional football running back. He was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the seventh round of the 2009 NFL draft. He also played for the Oakland Raiders and the New York Giants. Jennings played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers and the Liberty Flames.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Jennings began his high school career at Jefferson Forest High School in his hometown, Forest, Virginia. As a fifth string running back, he didn't play in a game until the last game of his junior year. As a self-described "270 lb. chubby kid with asthma and glasses", Jennings finally played after the first four running backs ahead of him on the depth chart went down with injuries and after his coach attempted to play a wide receiver at running back. On his first handoff he ran the ball in for a 30-yard touchdown. After a 40-yard rushing touchdown and scoring 2 more touchdowns on defense, Jennings was approached by a scout from the University of Tennessee who had come to see the starting running back.
