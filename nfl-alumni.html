<br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The NFL Alumni was originally formed in 1967, but it wasn't until 1977 that the organization was formally restructured into a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit under the leadership of Victor I. Maitland, who served as its founding Executive Director until 1989. Maitland served in a volunteer capacity, receiving a symbolic salary of $1 per year for his work. He is widely recognized as the architect who transformed the Alumni into the national organization it is today.<br/><br/>During his 12-year tenure, Maitland helped grow the association from fewer than 100 members into over 30 active chapters across the country. He launched many of the organization’s enduring philanthropic programs, including the NFL Alumni Charity Golf Classic Series, which became the largest charity golf series in the country by the mid-1980s, and the Super Bowl of Golf, a national championship event among regional winners. These initiatives helped establish the NFL Alumni as one of the most visible and impactful charitable organizations serving retired professional athletes.<br/><br/>In 1978, Maitland created the "Order of the Leather Helmet," the Alumni’s highest honor, awarded to individuals and institutions who have made significant contributions to the game of football. He received the award himself in 1986 in recognition of his service.<br/><br/>Maitland also oversaw the rebranding of the organization in the late 1970s, designing the official NFL Alumni logo and initiating the traditions of the gold Alumni blazers, signature rings, and neckties worn by members at ceremonial events. These designs were first introduced publicly in the NFL Alumni’s official 1977 publication Time Out, and they continue to define the organization’s visual identity today.
