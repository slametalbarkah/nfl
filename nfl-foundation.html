            The National Football League (NFL) Foundation, previously known as NFL Charities, is a non-profit making charitable organization, established by the member clubs of the National Football League (NFL) in 1973. It enables the clubs to collectively make grants to charitable and worthwhile causes at a national level.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Youth initiatives ==<br/><br/>The NFL Foundation works with USA Football to teach children the fundamentals of playing football safely. To help do so, the Foundation gives grants to youth and high school football teams.<br/><br/>Working with USA Football, the NFL Foundation also developed NFL FLAG, a non-tackle version of football.<br/><br/>The NFL Foundation is also responsible for creating a program called FUNdamentals which introduces the game of football to kids who have never played the sport before.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Heads Up Football ===<br/><br/>USA Football created Heads Up Football, in part funded by the NFL Foundation, to focus on improving several areas of football that relates to the safety of the players. This program teaches coaches better safety procedures and proper tackling drills. The NFL Foundation, as well as USA Football, have claimed that the program has helped reduce injuries by 76 percent and concussions by about 30 percent. However, research cited by the Foundation shows that Heads Up Football has shown no reduction of concussions and a significantly lower effect on injuries than claimed.
