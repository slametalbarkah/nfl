            Gameplay in American football consists of a series of downs, individual plays of short duration, outside of which the ball is or is not in play. These can be plays from the line of scrimmage – passes, runs, punts or field goal attempts (from either a place kick or a drop kick) – or free kicks such as kickoffs and fair catch kicks. Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as coaches choose the players best suited for each particular situation for offense, defense, and also special teams. During a play, each team should have a maximum of 11 players on the field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Objective of the game ==<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to score more points than the other team during the allotted time. Teams can score points by advancing the ball to reach the opposite end of the field, which is home to a scoring zone (the end zone) and the goalposts. Teams move the ball down the field by running a series of plays consisting of runs or passes. The team with the ball (the offense) has four plays (downs) to advance at least 10 yards. If the offense succeeds in advancing at least 10 yards, they earn a "first down," and the number of tries allotted is reset. The offense is again given four tries to advance an additional 10 yards, starting from the spot to which they last advanced.
